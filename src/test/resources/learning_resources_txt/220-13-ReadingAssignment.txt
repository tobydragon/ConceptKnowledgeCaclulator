What are advantages of using pass-by-reference over pass-by-pointer (i.e., when would you use pass-by-reference)?

What are the disadvantages of using pass-by-reference over pass-by-pointer (i.e., when would you use pass-by-pointer)?

Now that you see both pass-by-reference and pass-by-pointer, which would you use to pass the line counting parameter in our array library code? Why?
