Questions

Why might allocation of memory fail when using the new operator? What aspect of a computer  (amount of hard drive space, amount of RAM, processor speed, number of processors, etc.) would make it more likely that allocation would fail?

What is the difference between a dangling pointer and a memory leak? Why is each of them important?

What is  the main difference between arrays on the stack and arrays on the heap? What is a good reason to make an array on the heap instead of the stack?
